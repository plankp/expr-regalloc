## No seriously what is this?

I have been wanting to create a compiler for the longest time...

I'm somewhat comfortable at constructing lexers and parsers by now...
(As long as the grammar is not too weird, usually recursive descent does the job)

Type checking is ok...
After all, we did implement a mini typed functional language as a final project for one of my classes...

But interpreters and stack machines aside,
I've always gotten stuck on the code generation step
(say generating even very garbage code for amd64)...

So that's my motivation.
I'm going to try to actually learn to do this properly...

And so, this is what this repository is for.
I'm going to start-off by figuring out how to generate reasonable code for expressions
